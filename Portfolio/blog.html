        <h2 class="blog-card-title">The <span>Unglamorous</span> Side of Being a Web Developer</h2>
        <p class="blog-card-excerpt">
          Nobody tells you about the hours staring at a blank console, the Stack Overflow rabbit holes,
          or the feeling of breaking something that was perfectly fine five minutes ago. This is that story.

          <h3>THE CURSOR BLINKS. YOU STARE BACK.</h3>
          <p>
            There is a particular kind of silence that fills a room when your code refuses to work and you have no
            idea why. It is not peaceful. It is heavy — the kind that makes you question every decision that led you
            to sit in front of a screen, writing instructions to a machine that seems to take personal offense at
            your logic.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I started learning web development, I imagined it would feel like building things. Like construction —
            methodical, visual, satisfying. <strong>Nobody warned me it would mostly feel like debugging things.</strong>
            Like archaeology, except the ancient artifact is a function you wrote last Tuesday and can no longer understand.
          </p>

          <h3>THE BROWSER IS NOT YOUR FRIEND</h3>
          <p>
            One of the earliest lessons I learned was that browsers are wildly inconsistent. Something looks perfect in Chrome.
            You open Safari and suddenly everything is misaligned. Firefox renders your carefully crafted flexbox like it's
            still 2009. You spend three hours chasing a CSS bug that turns out to be a single missing semicolon three hundred lines up.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cross-browser compatibility is one of those things that sounds like a minor inconvenience until it devours your afternoon.
            Then your evening. Then the next morning, when you sit back down and realize you still haven't fixed it.
          </p>

          <div class="blog-highlight">
            <p>"I once spent an entire day tracking a layout bug. The fix was one line. The line was <code>box-sizing: border-box</code>.
            I will never forget this as long as I live."</p>
          </div>

          <h3>IMPOSTER SYNDROME IS VERY REAL</h3>
          <p>
            The web development community is enormous, and it can feel suffocating. Developers on YouTube build full-stack
            apps in an hour. Twitter threads casually mention fifteen tools you have never heard of. You start to wonder
            whether you are actually learning or just collecting half-finished tutorials.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>I felt this constantly.</strong> Especially in the beginning. Everyone seemed to already know everything,
            and I was still Googling how to center a div. (For the record — that is a completely legitimate thing to Google.
            Centering divs is genuinely confusing and has been for decades.)
          </p>

          <h3>WHEN NOTHING WORKS AND GOOGLE DOESN'T HELP</h3>
          <p>
            There is a specific kind of frustration reserved for the moment you search your exact error message and find
            a Stack Overflow thread from 2014 where someone marks a completely unrelated answer as accepted. Or when the
            documentation is technically correct but written in a way that assumes you already understand what you're
            trying to learn.
          </p>
          <p>
            Web development humbles you constantly. Some days you feel like you are making real progress. Other days you
            spend four hours learning that a feature you wanted to build is simply not supported in the browser version
            your users are on.
          </p>

          <h3>BUT HERE'S WHAT KEEPS ME GOING</h3>
          <p>
            Despite all of it — the bugs, the late nights, the moments of genuine despair — there is something uniquely
            satisfying about web development. When something finally works, when the layout snaps into place and the
            animation runs smoothly and the form submits without errors, it genuinely feels like you built something.
            Because you did.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every developer, no matter how experienced, still searches for things. Still breaks things. The difference
            is just how fast you get yourself unstuck. And that only comes with time.

        <h2 class="blog-card-title">Designing Is <span>Harder</span> Than It Looks</h2>
        <p class="blog-card-excerpt">
          Everyone assumes designers just pick pretty colors and move things around. They don't see the
          hours of research, the endless revisions, or the quiet grief of killing a design you loved because
          it just doesn't work for the user.

      <div class="blog-content" id="post-02-content">
        <div class="blog-content-inner">
          <h3>"JUST MAKE IT LOOK NICE"</h3>
          <p>
            If I had a peso for every time someone described design as "just making things look nice," I could
            probably afford a proper Figma license without thinking about it. The perception that design is a
            light, decorative layer laid on top of real work is one of the most persistent — and frustrating —
            misconceptions I have encountered.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Design is problem solving.</strong> It is research, iteration, testing, and compromise.
            It is spending two hours on a button — its size, weight, color, position, label, and hover state —
            because that button is the single most important interaction point on the entire screen.
          </p>

          <h3>THE BLANK CANVAS IS NOT INSPIRING</h3>
          <p>
            There is a myth that creatives sit down and inspiration flows. The blank Figma canvas has never once
            looked inspiring to me. It looks like a void of infinite possibility and infinite ways to get it wrong.
            The hard part of design is starting — deciding what this thing even is before you can decide what it
            should look like.
          </p>
          <p>
            Graphic design adds another layer. Typography alone is a discipline that takes years to really understand.
            Kerning, leading, hierarchy, pairing — the difference between text that feels premium and text that looks
            like a 2008 WordPress blog often comes down to spacing decisions most people will never consciously notice.
          </p>

          <div class="blog-highlight">
            <p>"Good design is invisible. Nobody notices when the layout is perfect. They only notice when it isn't.
            You spend hours making something and the best outcome is that nobody comments on it."</p>
          </div>

          <h3>CLIENT FEEDBACK AND THE ART OF NOT BREAKING</h3>
          <p>
            "Can you make the logo bigger?" "Can we try it in Comic Sans?" "I like it but can it be more pop?"
            If you have worked in any design capacity, you know exactly the kind of feedback I am describing.
            Feedback that arrives without context, without clear direction, and occasionally from someone who
            has never seen the brief.
          </p>
          <p>
            Learning to receive feedback without treating it as a personal attack on your taste is a genuine skill.
            <strong>Detaching from your work enough to revise it clearly, without losing the vision</strong> — that
            is something nobody teaches you in any tutorial.
          </p>

          <h3>UX IS AN ARGUMENT YOU HAVE WITH YOURSELF</h3>
          <p>
            UI/UX design means holding two competing instincts at the same time: what looks visually compelling,
            and what actually helps the user accomplish their goal. These are frequently in conflict. The dramatic
            full-screen hero animation you love slows down the page. The minimal, clean layout you planned has
            nowhere to put the information stakeholders insisted on including.
          </p>
          <p>
            User research should inform design decisions — but research takes time, and time is rarely something
            you have in abundance. So you make educated guesses, build empathy through intuition, and test wherever
            you can. And you accept that you will be wrong sometimes, and that the design will need to change.
          </p>

          <h3>THE REVISION THAT NEVER ENDS</h3>
          <p>
            Design is never finished. It is only abandoned when the deadline arrives. Every time you look at a
            completed project, you see the things you would have done differently. The hierarchy you would
            tighten. The color that doesn't quite sit right. The component you would rebuild from scratch
            given another day.
          </p>
          <p>
            That relentless eye for imperfection is part of what makes someone a good designer. But it is also
            exhausting to carry. Learning when good enough is actually good enough — and when it isn't —
            is something I am still actively working on.
          </p>

        <h2 class="blog-card-title">I Code — But <span>Design</span> Is Where I Live</h2>
        <p class="blog-card-excerpt">
          My portfolio says "front-end developer." My instincts say something different. Here's my honest
          reflection on where I truly thrive — and why I've stopped pretending those are the same thing.
        </p>

        <button class="blog-read-btn" onclick="togglePost('post-03', this)" aria-expanded="false">
          Read Post <span class="btn-arrow">→</span>
        </button>
      </div>

      <div class="blog-content" id="post-03-content">
        <div class="blog-content-inner">
          <h3>THE HONEST ADMISSION</h3>
          <p>
            I can build websites. I know my way around HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I can wire up a form, architect
            a component, debug a layout, and deploy to Netlify without breaking a sweat. By most definitions,
            I am a front-end developer.
          </p>
          <p>
            But if you sat me down and asked where I felt most in my element — most confident, most alive,
            most like I was doing exactly what I was meant to do — the honest answer would not be a code editor.
            <strong>It would be Figma.</strong>
          </p>

          <h3>WHERE THE ENERGY IS DIFFERENT</h3>
          <p>
            When I write code, I feel capable. I feel competent. I can solve the problem in front of me,
            and that is genuinely satisfying. But when I open a design file, something shifts. I am not
            just solving a problem — I am making a series of deliberate choices about how something should
            feel. How the eye should move. What should demand attention and what should quietly recede.
          </p>
          <p>
            That kind of thinking comes naturally to me in a way that debugging a JavaScript error simply
            doesn't. Design is where I stop working and start creating. The distinction feels important.
          </p>

          <div class="blog-highlight">
            <p>"I used to think I needed to pick one. Developer or designer. I've stopped thinking that way.
            But I've also stopped pretending they feel equal to me."</p>
          </div>

          <h3>WHAT GRAPHIC DESIGN GAVE ME</h3>
          <p>
            Before I ever wrote a line of HTML, I was making things in Photoshop. Posters, edits, layouts —
            anything visual I could get my hands on. Graphic design taught me to see: to notice color relationships,
            to feel when a composition is balanced versus when it only appears to be, to understand why certain
            fonts carry authority and others feel playful.
          </p>
          <p>
            That visual language became the foundation everything else was built on. When I design a UI,
            I am not working from a checklist of UX principles. I am trusting a deep, accumulated sense of
            what looks intentional and what looks accidental. <strong>That intuition was built through design,
            not development.</strong>
          </p>

          <h3>THE CODER WHO DESIGNS, OR THE DESIGNER WHO CODES?</h3>
          <p>
            There is real value in being able to do both. I would not trade my ability to implement my own designs —
            to see exactly how something will behave in a real browser rather than guessing from a static mockup.
            Knowing how things get built makes me a more grounded designer. I know what is feasible. I know
            what will require compromise.
          </p>
          <p>
            But my identity is clearer to me now than it was when I started. I am a designer who codes —
            not the other way around. My strongest ideas come from the visual side of my brain. My most
            confident hours are spent in a design tool, not a terminal.
          </p>

          <h3>WHY THIS MATTERS</h3>
          <p>
            I am writing this because I spent a long time trying to frame myself primarily as a developer
            because it sounded more technical, more serious, more like a career. And it is — development
            is a legitimate and challenging discipline. But leaning into it at the expense of my real
            strengths was doing me no favors.
          </p>
          <p>
            The work I am most proud of, the projects that genuinely excite me, the moments where feedback
            makes me feel seen — they almost always come from the design side of what I do. Recognizing
            that is not a limitation. It is clarity. And clarity, as any good designer will tell you,
            is where good work actually begins.
          </p>
